##ONoC Software
To test the results of  optical network on chip (ONoC) architectures we developed a tool which allowed us to simulate this theoretical nework on chip (NoC) setup. Our program allows us to feed it real-life log data files from an electrical NoC architecture to simulate the same events on a theoretical ONoC architecture. These log files can be run through a variety of different built in 'Analyzers' in our software package which allow users to easily view results such as what nodes are sending the most or least amount of data among other insights. The existing software specifically focuses on ONoC cyclical architectures but other specific ONoC architecture designs such as grid or tree layouts can be easily created using the underlying foundation classes. When simulating a cyclic architecture, IP nodes can be configured to be placed in specific positions in the layout. The software also allows for parameters like flit packet size, number of cycles for teardown time, and number of nodes in a specific architecture to be set and configured. This allows us to easily configure and test specific node configurations with our real-life log data.
